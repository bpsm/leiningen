Leiningen NEWS -- history of user-visible changes

= 1.0.0 / 2009-12-05

* Source, test, and compilation paths can be set in project.clj.

* Project code runs in an isolated classloader; can now compile/test
  projects that require a different version of Clojure from
  Leiningen. (Does not support 1.0's test-is yet.)

* Install task no longer requires maven to be installed.

* Only compile namespaces whose .class files are older than .clj files.

* Add "new" task for generating blank projects.

* Set <scm> tag when generating pom.xml.

* Include pom.xml, pom.properties, and more detailed manifest in jars.

* Summarize pass/fail counts from test runs across all namespaces.

* Accept a list of namespaces for test task rather than testing all.

* Create $PROJECT-standalone.jar file from uberjar to distinguish from
  regular jar files.

* Plugins have more flexibility to set the classpath and other
  arguments for running project code.

* Add resources/ directory to classpath and generated jars.

* Start Leiningen faster by using -Xbootclasspath argument.
